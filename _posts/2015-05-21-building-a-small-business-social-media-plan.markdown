title: Building A Small Business Social Media Plan
layout: post
---
Small business owners have so many things going on that creating a cost effective and profitable social media plan is nearly impossible. While I understand most of the platforms; Twitter, Facebook and others, I don't fully understand how to track and manage all the various platforms in one tool or dashboard.

So over the next few weeks my plan is to help a small business implement a plan and manage the interactions. A while back I came across a plan for posting on various social media platforms. I'm going to follow the plan, and manage everything in a tool that can used on the web and a mobile device. I will share on my site here, mostly to capture my workflow and the outcomes.

The steps I think I will follow will be:

1. Gather all the social media user names
2. Find a tool to use *
3. Add the social media users to the tool
4. Start posting and see how much activity is generated
